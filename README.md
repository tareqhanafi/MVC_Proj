# MVC_Proj
This is a Projcet that I'm working on right now along with the ASP.NET Core Course.

The project is for showcasing the ability to build a .NET Core MVC project from scratch, building a SQL SERVER Database, creating a .NET MVC project, modeling
the data with Database-First approach, bulding a controller-based backend and frontend views with Razor technology and performe CRUD Operations on the data.

The idea behind the project until now is that we created two DB Tables named Cities and Persons, the project is under development and for now the only thing a user
can do is CRUD operations to the two tables.
